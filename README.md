📊 Flipkart E-Commerce Data Analysis (5 Lakh+ Users)

🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a large-scale e-commerce dataset inspired by Flipkart, containing
5,00,000+ user records. The aim is to understand customer behavior, sales trends, and product
performance using Python-based data analysis and beginner-level machine learning techniques.

This project simulates real-world data analytics workflows used in e-commerce companies.

 🎯 Objectives
 Clean and preprocess large, messy real-world datasets  
 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
 Identify customer purchase patterns and sales trends  
 Build beginner-level machine learning models for prediction  
 Generate business-ready insights and reports  



 🗂 Dataset Description
 Total Records: 5,00,000+  
  Data Type: Customers, Orders, Products, Transactions  
 Data Issues:
   Missing values  
   Duplicate records  
   Outliers  
   Noisy real-world data  

⚠️ This dataset is inspired by Flipkart-style e-commerce data and is used strictly for educational purposes.
